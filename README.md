# 🧩 TSL Shader Patterns – Inspired by Three.js Journey


A full recreation of the **Shader Patterns** chapter from [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/shader-patterns), rebuilt using:

- 🧱 [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
- 🧪 [threejs Shading Language](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language) – a node-based shader abstraction
- ⚡ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- 🧰 [Tweakpane](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/) – for selecting patterns
